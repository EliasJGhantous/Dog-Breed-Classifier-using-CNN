# Dog-Breed-Classifier-using-CNN
This repository contains datasets and models pertaining to a dog breed classifier created using convolutional neural networks and transfer learning with PyTorch.

The required packages are torch, torchvision, Pillow and opencv. Ensure that all packages are updated.

The torchvision package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision. It is part of the PyTorch package.

Torch provides a flexible N-dimensional array or Tensor, which supports basic routines for indexing, slicing, transposing, type-casting, resizing, sharing storage and cloning. This object is used by most other packages and thus forms the core object of the library.

Python Imaging Library (abbreviated as PIL) (in newer versions known as Pillow) is a free and open-source additional library for the Python programming language that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

opencv exposes some of the available 'OpenCV' vision algorithms, such as edge, body or face detection. These can either be applied to analyze static images, or to filter live video footage from a camera device.
